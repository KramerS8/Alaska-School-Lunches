Functions: I used customized CSS styling codes to expand the map full screen and to style the legend. I used FontAwesome to add the Apple icon for point marker visualization and assigned a hex color to show Red. I used ColorBrewer to symbolize geographic features with a sequential color palette Greens. I changed the font from Times New Roman to Poppins from the Google Font library.
